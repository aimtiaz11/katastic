# Architecture Principles

The following are high-level architecture principles that we shall apply to the architecture of Road Warrior App:

## General Architecture

| Principle                         | Rationale                                                    | Implications                                                 | Characteristics                                                 |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Modular and Microservices Architecture             | To support the evolving nature of the Road Warrior app, it's essential to adopt an architecture that allows for easy modification, expansion, and replacement of individual components. | Components/services can be tested/deployed with minimal business disruption. Improved availability and reliability. With well defined API for each microservice, allows for flexibility in integrating new features and third-party services. Achieves Evolvability | 
| Distributed and Scalable       | As the Road Warrior app is expected to handle a growing number of users and data, optimizing for scalability is essential to ensure that the system can accommodate increasing workloads without compromising performance.| Evenly distribution of requests among server instances. Improving response times using, loadbalancing, caching and other strategies. Achieves Performance  |                   |
| Dynamic Configuration Management | To make the Road Warrior app adaptable to different user preferences and changing requirements, it's important to have a flexible configuration management system. | Accomodates different user preferences, Avoids code changes and also allows users to customize their ecperience through configurable settings.  Achieves Configurability                     |

##  Automation

| Principle                                            | Rationale                                                    | Implications                                                 |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Automated process by default and manual by exception | Process automation will bring efficiencies                   | Automated and Optimised processes. Humans can focus on more value added tasks. |
| Engineering Automation from start                    | Independently testable and deployable components using CI pipelines will improve reliability. | Reliability built into software means reduced time-to-market in later iterations. |

## Data

| Principle              | Rationale                                                    | Implications                                                 |
| :--------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Quality           | High-quality data improves decision-making, reduces errors, and helps in marketing | Business can effectively understand the user choices and preferences and use for various marketing and ease of usage.  |
| Data Integration     | Data integration enhances data accessibility and supports data-driven decision-making. |  Enables seamless data flow and integration between different systems and data sources. |

## Integration

| Principle                                        | Rationale                               | Implications                                                 |
| :----------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Loose Coupling | Reflects microservice principles  | Minimize dependencies and promote flexibility. Loose coupling allows components to change independently without affecting each other. |
| API-First Design | Well-defined APIs on top of microservices provide a standardized way for components to communicate.  |  Allows for flexibility in integrating new features and third-party services, thereby promoting Evolvability |


## Security

| Principle         | Rationale                                                    | Implications                                      |
| :---------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Security by Design | Security should be an integral part of the application design and development process from the beginning. Waiting until the end to address security can lead to costly and time-consuming retrofits. | Secured and protected organisation in digital era |
| Data Privacy and Compliance | Protecting user data and complying with privacy regulations are critical for maintaining trust and avoiding legal and financial consequences. | Helps avoid any privacy and compliance data exposure, which is prone to disastrous consequences |

## Extend-ability and Maintain-ability

| Principle                     | Rationale                                                    | Implications                                |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |
| System should be extendable   | New functionality will be required to support system evolution. | can support changing business needs.        |
| System should be Maintainable | Regular maintenance activities, fixing bugs are essential for any operational system. Will be able to perform change reliably and effectively | Least business disruption during the change |
